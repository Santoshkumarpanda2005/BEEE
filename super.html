	<h1> Superposition theroem</h1>
	<p>The Superposition Theorem is a fundamental principle in electrical circuit analysis that simplifies the process of analyzing complex linear circuits with multiple sources. It is particularly useful when dealing with circuits containing several independent sources such as voltage sources and current sources. The theorem states that the response (voltage or current) in a linear circuit with multiple sources is equal to the algebraic sum of the individual responses caused by each source acting alone, while the other sources are turned off or "nulled."<br>

Here are the key points of the Superposition Theorem:<br>

<h2>Linearity: </h2>The Superposition Theorem applies only to linear circuits. A circuit is considered linear if it satisfies two properties: homogeneity and additivity. The response of the circuit to a sum of sources is the same as the sum of the responses to individual sources.<br>

<h2>Sequential Analysis:</h2> To apply the Superposition Theorem, each independent source is considered one at a time while the others are set to zero (replaced by short circuits for voltage sources or open circuits for current sources). This sequential analysis is performed for each independent source in the circuit.<br>

<h2>Source Nulling:</h2> When analyzing the effect of a particular source, all other independent sources are "nulled" or deactivated. For voltage sources, they are replaced by short circuits, and for current sources, they are replaced by open circuits.<br>

<h2>Algebraic Summation:</h2> The total response (voltage or current) in the circuit is found by algebraically summing the individual responses obtained for each source during the sequential analysis.

Mathematically, if 
 
V is the voltage across a particular element or node, and 
 
I is the current through the element, the total response (

<p>The Superposition Theorem is a powerful tool for simplifying circuit analysis, especially in the context of circuits with multiple sources. However, it is important to note that the Superposition Theorem is not applicable to power calculations, as power is a nonlinear function of voltage and current.</p>
