        <h1>Thevenin's theorem</h1>
        <p>
            The theorem states that any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources and resistances can be replaced by an equivalent circuit comprising a single voltage source (Thevenin voltage) in series with a single resistor (Thevenin resistance). This equivalent circuit represents the original network's behavior as seen from two terminals.<br>

Here are the key components of Thevenin's Theorem:<br>

<h4>Thevenin Voltage (Vth):</h4> The open-circuit voltage at the terminals of interest. To find Vth, you "look back" into the circuit from the terminals while removing the load (i.e., open-circuit the terminals) and determine the voltage.<br>

<h4>Thevenin Resistance (Rth):</h4> The equivalent resistance seen from the terminals when all independent sources are turned off (replaced by their internal resistances). To find Rth, you remove the sources, set voltage sources to short circuit, and current sources to open circuit, and then calculate the equivalent resistance.<br>

<p>The Thevenin equivalent circuit is then a voltage source (Vth) in series with a resistor (Rth). This simplified representation is useful for analyzing and solving complex circuits, particularly when you're interested in the behavior of the circuit as seen from external connections.<br>

Thevenin's Theorem is particularly handy in simplifying circuit analysis and design, making it easier to understand and work with complex electrical networks. It is applicable to linear circuits, meaning that the relationship between voltage and current is linear, and it doesn't consider non-linear elements like diodes or transistors.</p>
