		<h1>Kirchoff Law</h1>
		There are of two types 
		-Kirchoff current law 
		-Kirchoff voltage law
<br>
		<h1>Kirchoff current law </h1><br>
	<p>Kirchhoff's Current Law is also known as the "first law" or the "junction rule."

The law states that the total current entering a junction (or node) in an electrical circuit is equal to the total current leaving the junction. In other words, the algebraic sum of currents at any node in a circuit is zero.</p>

<h1>Kirchoff voltage law</h1><br>
<p> KVL is also known as the "second law" or the "loop rule."

The law states that the total voltage around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops across the components within that loop. </p>
